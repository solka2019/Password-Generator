Password Generator
------------------ 

Your application's GitHub repository should contain a README.md file explaining the purpose and functionality of the application. The README.md file should include a screenshot of the completed application as well as a link to the deployed GitHub Pages URL.

----------------------

The purpose of this application is to generate a random strong password that may be used in companies that handle large amounts of sensitive data, diminishing any security threat. 

 The functionality of this application is based on the user's choices of characteres.

When user clicks on "generate password," it will alert that it needs a number of the lenght of the password.


If no button is clicked, then the application won't create the password and will repeat the alert asking for the lenght of the password.

 The user has to make at least one choice for the application to generate a random password. If the user chooses all of the options (Upper case letters, Lower case letters, Numeric, Special characteres), then the password will show with a mix of all of them in the length that was designated by the user. 

After having the password generated, the user can "copy to clipboard" and use it in the desired application.
